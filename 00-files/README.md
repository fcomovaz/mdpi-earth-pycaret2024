## What Files do I need here?

> This study focuses on Salamanca Guanajuato City, if you want to use another city from SMAOT please be aware to change in almost all the files the name of the city from Salamanca to your_target_city

* Please download the selected data from this url [SMAOT Data](https://smaot.guanajuato.gob.mx/sitio/historicos/)
* You need to paste the zip file in this folder and, after change the name of the selected city in the most of the files, run the `00-pipeline.py` script, this file automatically will run the whole pipeline, if something fails, you can retake any step from line 24 an change 0 to the number of the failed step after fixing the error.
